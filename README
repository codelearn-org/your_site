Welcome to CodeLearn Playground

This area is the Code Editor. You can edit the code here & hit the save button on the top right to save the content of the file.

Apart from the Code Editor, there are three more tabs marked Console, File Browser & App Output. Console is a linux console emulated on the browser. You can try rails commands there.

App Output is where you can see the output of the app once you have fired the rails server in Console.


Happy Rails Learning.
